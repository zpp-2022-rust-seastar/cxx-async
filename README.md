# `cxx-async`

## Overview

`cxx-async` is a Rust crate that extends the [`cxx`](http://cxx.rs/) library to provide
interoperability between asynchronous Rust code using `async`/`await` and [C++20 coroutines] using
`co_await`. If your C++ code is asynchronous, `cxx-async` can provide a more convenient, and
potentially more efficient, alternative to callbacks. You can freely convert between C++ coroutines
and Rust futures and/or streams and await one from the other.

It's important to emphasize what `cxx-async` isn't: it isn't a C++ binding to Tokio or any other
Rust I/O library. Nor is it a Rust binding to `boost::asio` or similar. Such bindings could in
principle be layered on top of `cxx-async` if desired, but this crate doesn't provide them out of
the box. (Note that this is a tricky problem even in theory, since Rust async I/O code is generally
tightly coupled to a single library such as Tokio, in much the same way C++ async I/O code tends to
be tightly coupled to libraries like `boost::asio`.) If you're writing server code, you can still
use `cxx-async`, but you will need to ensure that both the Rust and C++ sides run separate I/O
executors.

`cxx-async` aims for compatibility with popular C++ coroutine support libraries. The ones supported right now are the lightweight [`cppcoro`](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro), the more comprehensive
[Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly/) and Scylla's [Seastar](https://github.com/scylladb/seastar). Pull requests are welcome to support
others.

## Quick tutorial

To use `cxx-async`, first start by adding `cxx` to your project. Then add the following to your
`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cxx-async = "0.1"
```

Now, inside your `#[cxx::bridge]` module, declare a future type and some methods like so:

```rust
#[cxx::bridge]
mod ffi {
    // Declare type aliases for each of the future types you wish to use here. Then declare
    // async C++ methods that you wish Rust to call. Make sure they return one of the future
    // types you declared.
    unsafe extern "C++" {
        type RustFutureString = crate::RustFutureString;

        fn hello_from_cpp() -> RustFutureString;
    }

    // Async Rust methods that you wish C++ to call go here. Again, make sure they return one of the
    // boxed future types you declared above.
    extern "Rust" {
        fn hello_from_rust() -> Box<RustFutureString>;
    }
}
```

After the `#[cxx::bridge]` block, define the future types using the `#[cxx_async::bridge]`
attribute:

```rust
// The inner type is the Rust type that this future yields.
#[cxx_async::bridge]
unsafe impl Future for RustFutureString {
    type Output = String;
}
```

Now, in your C++ file, make sure to `#include` the right headers:

```cpp
#include "rust/cxx.h"
#include "rust/cxx_async.h"
#include "rust/cxx_async_cppcoro.h"  // Or cxx_async_folly.h, as appropriate.
```

And add a call to the `CXXASYNC_DEFINE_FUTURE` macro to define the C++ side of the future:

```cpp
// The first argument is the C++ type that the future yields, and the second argument is the
// fully-qualified name of the future, with `::` namespace separators replaced with commas. (For
// instance, if your future is named `mycompany::myproject::RustFutureString`, you might write
// `CXXASYNC_DEFINE_FUTURE(rust::String, mycompany, myproject, RustFutureString);`. The first
// argument is the C++ type that `cxx` maps your Rust type to: in this case, `String` maps to
// `rust::String`, so we supply `rust::String` here.
//
// This macro must be invoked at the top level, not in a namespace.
CXXASYNC_DEFINE_FUTURE(rust::String, RustFutureString);
```

You're all set! Now you can define asynchronous C++ code that Rust can call:

```cpp
RustFutureString hello_from_cpp() {
    co_return std::string("Hello world!");
}
```

On the Rust side:

```rust
async fn call_cpp() -> String {
    // This returns a Result (with the error variant populated if C++ threw an exception), so you
    // need to unwrap it:
    ffi::hello_from_cpp().await.unwrap()
}
```

And likewise, define some asynchronous Rust code that C++ can call:

```rust
use cxx_async::CxxAsyncResult;
fn hello_from_rust() -> RustFutureString {
    // You can instead use `fallible` if your async block returns a Result.
    RustFutureString::infallible(async { "Hello world!".to_owned() })
}
```

Over on the C++ side:

```cpp
cppcoro::task<rust::String> call_rust() {
    co_return hello_from_rust();
}
```

That's it! You should now be able to freely await futures on either side. An analogous procedure can
be followed to wrap C++ coroutines that yield values with `co_yield` in Rust streams.

## Installation notes

You will need a C++ compiler that implements the coroutines TS, which generally coincides with
support for C++20. Some C++ compilers (e.g. Apple clang 13.0.0) that implement the coroutines TS
crash when compiling Folly. It's also recommended to use `libc++` instead of `libstdc++`, as the
former has more complete support for coroutines.

Usage of `cxx-async` with Folly requires that Folly have been built with coroutine support. This
generally means that you need to build Folly with `-DCXX_STD=20`. Many distributions of Folly (e.g.
the one in Homebrew) don't have coroutine support enabled; a common symptom of this is a linker
error mentioning a missing symbol `folly::resumeCoroutineWithNewAsyncStackRoot`.

## Code of conduct

`cxx-async` follows the same Code of Conduct as Rust itself. Reports can be made to the crate
